## Basic Introduction to Numpy

Numpy is one of the python library which is mainly used for numerical computing. It provides the support to multidimensional arrays which are the most basic data structure of most Machine Learning algorithms.

There are few advantages of using Numpy
- Provides fast and efficient operations on arrays of homogeneous data.
- Numpy arrays takes less space.
- Numpy arrays are small in size than python list.
